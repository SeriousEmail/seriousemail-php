# seriousemail-php

A PHP class to help access the Serious.Email API and trigger HTML email sends.  You may send one or more emails and as many emails as your account allows.

## Getting Started

Download this class and example to help you trigger email sends at Serious.email.

### Prerequisites

This class requires an account Serious.email.  https://serious.email

### Installing

This API requires that you set up a few things at Serious.email.

**Step 1: Generate a public_api_key and api_secret**

https://serious.email/account/settings#tab_api-settings

*Note the api_secret and keep in a safe place as it will only be revealed once.  In the event you forget it, you'll need to regenerate your keys again.*


**Step 2: Create a subscribers list**

https://serious.email/subscribers-manager

Subscribers that you add via this API will be saved to this list.  This enables comprehensive analytics, future sends and data back-up.


**Step 3: Create a campaign and note it's ID**

https://serious.email/campaigns-manager

You will include this ID when using this API to trigger a send.

Use the settings dialog to indicate a default subcriber list, default test subscriber list, sender name and sender email.


**Step 4: Create an email template**

https://serious.email/templates-manager

This is the template that will be sent to your remotely added subscribers.


**Step 5: Download(https://github.com/dommermuth/seriousemail-php/archive/master.zip) this class and add it to your project.**

Now that you have set-up everything at Serious.email you can start sending emails.  Simply add this class to your PHP project:

require_once('lib/SeriousEmail.php');
...


Step 6: Use the example provided as a basis for adding your own content.
